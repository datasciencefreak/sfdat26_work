# Question 1: 

Automatically categorize Internet of Things (IoT) devices based on the header field values within the WiFi packets they send out. Once a classification is successfully done:

* Detect new devices as they are added to the network
* Detect MAC spoofing attempts on older already discovered devices by an attacker using outlier detection


## Training Data

We will be collecting the training data by running Wi-Fi network monitoring devices and capture the packets sent by IoT devices. We have already created a lab of around 5 different IoT devices to get the training set from.


## Features

Each Wi-Fi packet has header fields which change based on the packet type and other associated activities. We will be primarily focusing on 802.11 Information Elements fields which are in the form of TLVs (type-length-value).
